    InWorldz Viewer is brought to you by McCabe Maxsted and InWorldz, LLC, based on the Snowglobe Viewer.

    Thanks go to the Snowglobe contributors as well as those who've contributed to the opensource Second Life viewer.

    Thanks also go out to our InWorldz Mentors, without them, our IDI would be a lonely confusing place for our New Residents! Thank you, each of you, for taking time out of your day to be there to answer the questions, endure the lag, the facepalms, and just generally being of good spirits in guiding the new users. To our residents, because without each and every single one of you, we wouldn't have a reason to have mentors or a grid! Thank you for your perserverance with the bugs, the cans of bugspray often needed, the humor, and the grace to have the patience with pioneering!
